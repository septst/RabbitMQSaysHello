# RabbitMQ Says Hello

This is a sample project I created following the official RabbitMQ getting started guide [here](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-dotnet.html). This covers the following topics:

1. Simple Send/Receive
2. Work Queues
3. Publish/Subscribe
4. Routing
5. Topic
6. RPC

## Setup

Use the docker-compose file as below to start a new container instance of RabbitMQ.

`docker-compose up --build`

Once the container is started, you can access RabbitMQ from the browser by accessing [this link](http://localhost:15672).
